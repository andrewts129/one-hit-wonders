# one-hit-wonders
Quantifying the biggest one hit wonders from 1958 - present

Using total play counts of an artist's top ten songs, their "one-hit-wonderness" is calculated by the ratio:
(standard deviation of play including top song) / (standard deviation of play excluding top song)

The visualization is currently in progress, it can be seen at http://www.andrewsmith.io/biggest-one-hit-wonders
